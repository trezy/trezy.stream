***Spoiler: This shit should really be commonÂ sense.***

Corporate development environments tend to be stuffy, cubicle laden wastelands of busted keyboards, crazy-haired troll dolls, and silo'd development. This might be fine for the accounting team (let's be real, it's definitely not) but your developers need so much more. These are the five most important things to me in a work environment.

## #1â€Š-â€ŠLet me work where I please,Â please.

I get that being able to keep an eye on me makes you feel better, like you know that I'm doing my job. However, that doesn't change the fact that the work I do in an 8 hour day at the office could be supplanted by the 2 hours in a coffee shop. Environment has a massive impact on productivity and unless you are going to move a [Colectivo](https://colectivocoffee.com) into our office then you should be willing to give me some autonomy to decide when and where I work. This is the digital age where most companies are able to operate completely in online space. Spending some time working outside of the office shouldn't be a problem.

Many startups offer this option with the caveat that certain meetings require physical attendance and that you must set up a certain, small amount of office hours that are consistent every week. That way I get my freedom and you know that you will always be able to find me.

## #2â€Š-â€ŠI'm smart. Take advantage ofÂ it.

Most companies make technical decisions with no input from the boots on the ground. I work on this stuff every day, most of the time more than just what I do at the office. I've been doing it for more years than some developers have been alive. Not only do I know the limitations of my technologies, I'm also itching to implement the coolest new gidgets and push the boundaries of what we're doing. If you're making all of the decisions without my input you're not utilizing any of that. You can hand me a spec and it'll come out shiny and perfect but if you take my input on an idea, we can take it in amazing directions that you didn't even know were possible.

Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean that I think I'm smarter than you or anyone else. The issue is that I'm building up this knowledge everyday so that I can be better and contribute more to our projects. If you're not taking advantage of it then *you're doing it wrong.*

The Hidden Brain podcast did an episode exploring a similar issue with doctors. The greatest insight I took away from that episode is that working with programmers is *a lot* like working with doctors; they greatly value their autonomy and they want to know that their wisdom is being respected.

## #3â€Š-â€ŠGive back to openÂ source.

Most developers are intimately familiar with the concept of open source software. They spend their days using tools and software made freely available by somebody else. Unfortunately the corporate world isn't as keenly aware that they owe a huge debt to the open source community. Open source software is the playground on which a lot of us learned and perfected our craft. It's given far more to us than just free toolsâ€Š-â€Šit's given us the knowledge that got us these stuffy corporate gigs.

If your developers owe something to open source, so do you. 20% programs are an amazing thing that every company should be supporting. Employees spend 20% of their overall work time doing whatever they pleaseâ€Š-â€Šfixing bugs, refactoring clunky old code, writing new features, or *contributing to open source.* That last one makes most of us feel all warm and fuzzy inside which, in turn, makes us better, happier worker bees.

## #4â€Š-â€ŠDon't act like theÂ NSA.

Every search is tracked by Google. Every turn my GPS tells me to take is tracked by Apple. Every step I take is tracked by a Fitbit. I think enough of my life is already being tracked, don't you? So why is it that when I walk into a corporate setting I have to worry about being tracked by cameras? Why is it that my keystrokes are being logged and analyzed (does it *really* matter what I did with that 50 gallon drum of KY Jelly)? Why is it that somebody is counting the number of bathroom breaks I takeâ€½

The problem is big enough that The Hustle just wrote a piece about it. I don't give a shit what you're doing with that data. If I'm still stuck in a cubicle then it's obviously not going towards improving my environment and I am not okay with being tracked like a homicide suspect. If you really, really, *really* want to know my browser history, just ask. If I say no, it's probably because I don't want you to fire me for reading blogs to become a better developer. Which leads me to my final pointâ€¦

## #5â€Š-â€ŠNo, I am not omniscient.

There's this ridiculous phenomenon I keep seeing where employers seem to expect us, as developers, to know everything. They then discount all other expertise we maintain when we admit to not having an answer.

*Are you effing serious right now?*

It takes far more wisdom to admit that you don't have the answer than it does to make up some load of bullshit and shovel it onto your boss's desk. The best developers are the ones that recognize their knowledge gaps and actively seek out new information to fill them. They don't tell you what you want to hear. They tell you that your idea is stupid and your toupÃ© is stupid, but then they're willing to tell you why and listen to you refute it.

## BONUSâ€Š-â€ŠStop sexually harassing your employees.

As a white guy, this didn't originally cross my mind, but my colleague, [Olivia Barrow](https://artplusmarketing.com/@oliviabarrow), brought it up and hot damn, I'd be absolutely remiss if I didn't mention it. Just because somebody works for you doesn't make you better than, and just because somebody is of the sex you're attracted to doesn't mean that you are required to make sexual advances towards them. That this even needs to be on the list is downright embarrassing. If you wouldn't do it outside of the workplace, don't do it at work. If you would do it outside of the workplace... Well, then stop doing it there, too. ðŸ˜¡

## It's time to stop beingÂ shitty.

Luckily, I've never experienced an employer where every one of these things is an issue. I've been through all of them individually, and I've also heard the horror stories of colleagues dealing with the awfulness that these issues breed. Nobody wants to deal with this crap as a developer, but even more, as an employer I can guarantee you don't want to deal with the cost of churn that comes with wanting to enforce a nanny state on your employees, so stop it. Invest in your employees and trust them, and you'll watch them flourish. ðŸŒ·
