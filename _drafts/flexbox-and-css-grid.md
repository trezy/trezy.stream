***…or, why you should never ever ever ever EVER EVER EVVAR USE FLOATS***

First things first: you should definitely use floats. Floats are an amazingly valuable tool in content formatting.

<figure class="pull-left">
  <img src="https://trezy.sh/MvyrT.jpeg" alt="A tiny, adorable puppy in a teacup">

  <figcaption>Can you just take a moment and imagine this puppy being sad? OH, THE HORROR...</figcaption>
</figure>

Without floats, we couldn't have this super cute picture of a puppy in a teacup hanging out beside our text. This puppy would be a very sad puppy and we can't have sad puppies, now can we? That would be absolutely *unacceptable*.

If we're actually *supposed* to use floats, then why in the world does the title of this article state so fervently otherwise?

Well, it's because content **layout** and content **formatting** are actually different things. Duh.
