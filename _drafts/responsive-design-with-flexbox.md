Responsive design is awesome. Flexbox is awesome. The new CSS units - specifically `vh` and `vw `- are awesome. **So why haven't you started using them yet‽**

## Support

Let's get this support stuff out of the way immediately since you obviously don't want to waste your time with tech you can't use. Flexbox is supported by all modern browsers. Unless you have to support IE 9 or below you're good to use Flexbox! `vh` and `vw` are supported back to IE 9, so use away.
