title:  "React is not the only way."

This morning I was asked for my opinion on React. This is an increasingly common occurrence as I encounter more and more junior front end devs. This year, I'm asked for my opinion on React. For a couple of years before that, I was often asked for my opinion on Angular. Before that, it was Ember. Before that it was Backbone. You get the point.

The issue here is that developers are being told that there's only one framework that they need to know or that there's an industry standard. This is a lie, and it's a lie that's particularly appealing - and damaging - to developers of *any* skill level that are just entering or recently rejoining the world of Javascript.

This lie is perpetrated with the best of intentions but the worst of outcomes. Going in with this idea means that developers have a much more narrow world view and they don't have to experience the analysis paralysis that comes with 

The goal is to give developers an easy route into the exceptionally complicated and polluted world of Javascript. Instead of evaluating the many frameworks or deciding for themselves if there's value in a broader knowledge base, we're told to pick up the framework of the day and focus on that without any concern for what happens when it's thrown to the wayside in favor of the next new, sexy thing.

Admittedly, there is some merit to this approach. Gathering a solid base of knowledge in a single discipline, e.g. React, allows us to grasp some fundamentals of the wider world and eventually branch out to learn more about what else is happening in the world. However, the current approach isn't achieving this goal. Instead it's pushing junior devs into a bubble from which they won't emerge for many years. They're stuck in an echo chamber where everyone is reciting the same archaic incantations from whatever special thing they're using and this poor junior dev is subjected to the old guard's vitriol for everything else that has ever existed.

Anybody who knows me, technologist or not, knows I used to be a core contributor for [Backbone.Marionette](https://marionettejs.com), but I now build my sites with React. I even like a couple of things about Ember and Angular, though I may spew about them a fair amount of the same vitriol I shunned earlier. I do try, though, to make sure that junior devs realize that there's a bigger world out there. Javascript isn't just React, or just Angular, or just Backbone. It's not Gulp or Grunt, and it's not just Webpack. All of these options come together to form the rich Javascript ecosystem that we have today. 

This ecosystem is big, and it's confusing, and it's scary. It's also beautifully diverse and incredibly driven. It's changing quickly enough that it's impossible for any one person to keep up with, which is why we're a community. No, Mr. Junior Developer, you are not alone.
