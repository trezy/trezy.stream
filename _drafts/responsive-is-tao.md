Since its inception responsive web design (RWD) has become recognized as the only way to approach a web dev project. It's beneficial for our users in hundred different ways and 

If you've created a responsive site you already know the cold, hard truth: RWD is hard. You have to perfect the same design for several different screen sizes across several different devices with several different browsers. Then you have to perfect the functionality the same way even though the several different browsers across the several different devices don't support all of the same things. It can be extremely overwhelming.

The thing is… it doesn't have to be. Instead of trying to control the browser we need to release our death grip and, instead, help the browser to display our content because responsive is Tao. If we accept the ebb and flow of things we can begin creating better, simpler, more beautiful websites.

## The browser knows best
